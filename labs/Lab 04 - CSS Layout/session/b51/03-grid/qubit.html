      <h1>Qubit</h1>
      <p>
        In quantum computing, a <strong>qubit</strong> (/ˈkjuːbɪt/) or quantum
        bit is a basic unit of quantum information—the quantum version of the
        classic binary bit physically realized with a two-state device. A qubit
        is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the
        simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum
        mechanics. Examples include the spin of the electron in which the two
        levels can be taken as spin up and spin down; or the polarization of a
        single photon in which the two states can be taken to be the vertical
        polarization and the horizontal polarization. In a classical system, a
        bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum
        mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superposition of both
        states simultaneously, a property that is fundamental to quantum
        mechanics and quantum computing.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The coining of the term qubit is attributed to Benjamin Schumacher. In
          the acknowledgments of his 1995 paper, Schumacher states that the term
          qubit was created in jest during a conversation with William Wootters.

        <h2>Bit versus qubit</h2>
        <p>
          A binary digit, characterized as 0 or 1, is used to represent
          information in classical computers. When averaged over both of its
          states (0, 1), a binary digit can represent up to one bit of Shannon
          information, where a bit is the basic unit of information. However, in
          this article, the word bit is synonymous with a binary digit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In classical computer technologies, a processed bit is implemented by
          one of two levels of low DC voltage, and whilst switching from one of
          these two levels to the other, a so-called “forbidden zone” between
          two logic levels must be passed as fast as possible, as electrical
          voltage cannot change from one level to another instantaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two possible outcomes for the measurement of a qubit—usually
          taken to have the value “0” and “1”, like a bit or binary digit.
          However, whereas the state of a bit can only be either 0 or 1, the
          general state of a qubit according to quantum mechanics can be a
          coherent superposition of both. Moreover, whereas a measurement of a
          classical bit would not disturb its state, a measurement of a qubit
          would destroy its coherence and irrevocably disturb the superposition
          state. It is possible to fully encode one bit in one qubit. However, a
          qubit can hold more information, e.g., up to two bits using superdense
          coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a system of n components, a complete description of its state in
          classical physics requires only n bits, whereas in quantum physics it
          requires 2n complex numbers (or a single point in a 2n-dimensional
          vector space).

        <h2>Quantum register</h2>
        <p>
          A number of qubits taken together is a qubit register. Quantum
          computers perform calculations by manipulating qubits within a
          register.

          <h3>Qudits and qutrits</h3>
          <p>
            The term qudit denotes the unit of quantum information that can be
            realized in suitable d-level quantum systems. A qubit register that
            can be measured to N states is identical to an N-level qudit. A
            rarely used synonym for qudit is quNit, since both d and N are
            frequently used to denote the dimension of a quantum system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Qudits are similar to the integer types in classical computing, and
            may be mapped to (or realized by) arrays of qubits. Qudits where the
            d-level system is not an exponent of 2 can not be mapped to arrays
            of qubits. It is for example possible to have 5-level qudits.

        <h2>Qubit storage</h2>
        <p>
          In 2008 a team of scientists from the U.K. and U.S. reported the first
          relatively long (1.75 seconds) and coherent transfer of a
          superposition state in an electron spin “processing” qubit to a
          nuclear spin “memory” qubit. This event can be considered the first
          relatively consistent quantum data storage, a vital step towards the
          development of quantum computing. In 2013, a modification of similar
          systems (using charged rather than neutral donors) has dramatically
          extended this time, to 3 hours at very low temperatures and 39 minutes
          at room temperature. Room temperature preparation of a qubit based on
          electron spins instead of nuclear spin was also demonstrated by a team
          of scientists from Switzerland and Australia. An increased coherence
          of qubits is being explored by researchers who are testing the
          limitations of a Ge hole spin-orbit qubit structure.
