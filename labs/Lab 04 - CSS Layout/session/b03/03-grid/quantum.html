      <h1>Quantum computing</h1>
      <p>
        A <strong>quantum computer</strong> is a computer that exploits quantum
        mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits
        properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages
        this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot
        explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum
        computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any
        modern “classical” computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum
        computer could break widely-used encryption schemes and aid physicists
        in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the
        art is still largely experimental and impractical.
      </p>

      <p>
        The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar
        to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a
        qubit can exist in a superposition of its two “basis” states, which
        loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a
        qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a
        quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave
        interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The
        design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a
        quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a
        physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it
        suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations.
        National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that
        aims to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower
        error rates. Two of the most promising technologies are superconductors
        (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical
        resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using
        electromagnetic fields).
      </p>
      <p>
        Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can
        also be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, any problem that can
        be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical
        computer, at least in principle given enough time. In other words,
        quantum computers obey the Church-Turing thesis. This means that while
        quantum computers provide no additional advantages over classical
        computers in terms of computability, quantum algorithms for certain
        problems have significantly lower time complexities than corresponding
        known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum computers are believed to
        be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer
        could solve in any feasible amount of time—a feat known as “quantum
        supremacy.” The study of the computational complexity of problems with
        respect to quantum computers is known as quantum complexity theory.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science
            formed distinct academic communities. Modern quantum theory
            developed in the 1920s to explain the wave-particle duality observed
            at atomic scales, and digital computers emerged in the following
            decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations. Both
            disciplines had practical applications during World War II;
            computers played a major role in wartime cryptography, and quantum
            physics was essential for the nuclear physics used in the Manhattan
            Project.
          </p>
          <p>
            As physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational
            problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum
            mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul
            Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum
            theory to describe a simplified computer. When digital computers
            became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead
            when simulating quantum dynamics, prompting Yuri Manin and Richard
            Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum
            phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation. In a 1984
            paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to
            cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key
            distribution could enhance information security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as
            Deutsch's algorithm in 1985, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm in
            1993, and Simon's algorithm in 1994. These algorithms did not solve
            practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could
            gain more information by querying a black box in superposition,
            sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism. Peter Shor built on
            these results with his 1994 algorithms for breaking the widely-used
            RSA and Diffie-Hellman encryption protocols, which drew significant
            attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover's
            algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely-applicable
            unstructured search problem. The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that
            quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the
            exponential overhead present in classical simulations, validating
            Feynman's 1982 conjecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The threshold theorem shows how increasing the number of qubits can
            mitigate errors, yet fully fault-tolerant quantum computing remains
            “a rather distant dream”. According to some researchers, noisy
            intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines may have specialized uses
            in the near future, but noise in quantum gates limits their
            reliability. In recent years, investment in quantum computing
            research has increased in the public and private sectors. As one
            consulting firm summarized,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              ... investment dollars are pouring in, and quantum-computing
              start-ups are proliferating. ... While quantum computing promises
              to help businesses solve problems that are beyond the reach and
              speed of conventional high-performance computers, use cases are
              largely experimental and hypothetical at this early stage.

          <h2>Algorithms</h2>
          <p>
            Progress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this
            quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic
            algorithm exist. Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by
            the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical
            algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over
            the best-known classical algorithm include Shor's algorithm for
            factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete
            logarithms, solving Pell's equation, and more generally solving the
            hidden subgroup problem for abelian finite groups. These algorithms
            depend on the primitive of the quantum Fourier transform. No
            mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast
            classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is
            considered unlikely. Certain oracle problems like Simon's problem
            and the Bernstein–Vazirani problem do give provable speedups, though
            this is in the quantum query model, which is a restricted model
            where lower bounds are much easier to prove and doesn't necessarily
            translate to speedups for practical problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical
            processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation
            of certain Jones polynomials, and the quantum algorithm for linear
            systems of equations have quantum algorithms appearing to give
            super-polynomial speedups and are BQP-complete. Because these
            problems are BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for
            them would imply that no quantum algorithm gives a super-polynomial
            speedup, which is believed to be unlikely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some quantum algorithms, like Grover's algorithm and amplitude
            amplification, give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical
            algorithms. Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic
            speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a
            wide range of problems. Many examples of provable quantum speedups
            for query problems are related to Grover's algorithm, including
            Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm for finding collisions in
            two-to-one functions, which uses Grover's algorithm, and Farhi,
            Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees, which
            is a variant of the search problem.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              There are a number of technical challenges in building a
              large-scale quantum computer. Physicist David DiVincenzo has
              listed these requirements for a practical quantum computer:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Physically scalable to increase the number of qubits</li>
              <li>Qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values</li>
              <li>Quantum gates that are faster than decoherence time</li>
              <li>Universal gate set</li>
              <li>Qubits that can be read easily</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Sourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult.
              Superconducting quantum computers, like those constructed by
              Google and IBM, need helium-3, a nuclear research byproduct, and
              special superconducting cables made only by the Japanese company
              Coax Co.
            </p>
            <p>
              The control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and
              coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight
              and deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the
              development of quantum controllers which enable interfacing with
              the qubits. Scaling these systems to support a growing number of
              qubits is an additional challenge.
            </p>
            <section>
              <h4>Decoherence</h4>
              <p>
                One of the greatest challenges involved with constructing
                quantum computers is controlling or removing quantum
                decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its
                environment as interactions with the external world cause the
                system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also
                exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice
                vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical
                system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is
                irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually
                something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided.
                Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the
                transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also
                called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds
                and seconds at low temperature. Currently, some quantum
                computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin
                (usually using a dilution refrigerator) in order to prevent
                significant decoherence. A 2020 study argues that ionizing
                radiation such as cosmic rays can nevertheless cause certain
                systems to decohere within milliseconds.

            <h3>Quantum supremacy</h3>
            <p>
              Quantum supremacy is a term coined by John Preskill referring to
              the engineering feat of demonstrating that a programmable quantum
              device can solve a problem beyond the capabilities of
              state-of-the-art classical computers. The problem need not be
              useful, so some view the quantum supremacy test only as a
              potential future benchmark.

            <h3>Skepticism</h3>
            <p>
              Some researchers have expressed skepticism that scalable quantum
              computers could ever be built, typically because of the issue of
              maintaining coherence at large scales, but also for other reasons.

            <h3>Computability</h3>
            <p>
              Any computational problem solvable by a classical computer is also
              solvable by a quantum computer. Intuitively, this is because it is
              believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of
              classical computers, can be described using quantum mechanics,
              which underlies the operation of quantum computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also
              solvable by a classical computer. It is possible to simulate both
              quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and
              a pen, if given enough time. More formally, any quantum computer
              can be simulated by a Turing machine. In other words, quantum
              computers provide no additional power over classical computers in
              terms of computability. This means that quantum computers cannot
              solve undecidable problems like the halting problem and the
              existence of quantum computers does not disprove the Church-Turing
              thesis.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Complexity</h3>
            <p>
              While quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical
              computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can
              solve certain problems faster than classical computers. For
              instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently
              factor integers, while this is not believed to be the case for
              classical computers.
